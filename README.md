# Forecasting-ANTAMStockPrices
This study compares ARIMAX-GARCH and LSTM to forecast ANTM.JK closing prices from Jan 1, 2018 to Oct 30, 2023, using R and Python. World nickel futures used as exogenous variable. Heteroscedasticity led to ARIMAX-GARCH modeling, but LSTM outperformed it and is the best model (MAPE 7.206%).
